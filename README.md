springangular
===================

Sample project for demonstrating Spring and Angular workflow using Node.js, Bower, Maven and Grunt.
The project was used as part of a presentation at javaBin Vestfold.

The project makes use of the frontend-maven-plugin to download/install Node and NPM locally for your project, runs NPM install, Grunt and/or gulp and/or Karma.

The plugin is not meant to replace the developer version of Node - frontend developers will still install Node on their laptops, but backend developers can run a clean build without even installing Node on their computer.

## TODO LIST:
* For completeness, this project also need to demonstrate tests and running unit tests and e2e tests.
* Document the use and typical development flow.
